~ Dean Kamen, Founder of FIRST Robotics

By encouraging the youth of America to innovate and explore science and technology, FIRST has promoted the growth of STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) across the United States in the hopes of growing the nation’s interest in those fields. Programs endorsed by FIRST range from the FIRST Junior Lego League to the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), targeting high school students and younger. As articulated by their mission statement:

Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.
