## Meet ATLaS
_Advanced Teleoperated Launching System_

**ATLaS** our first competition robot, was built for the FRC game Aerial Assist. For more information on Aerial Assist, visit the [FIRST website](https://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/About_Us/Media_Center/FRC_Assets/2014_FRC_Game_1page.pdf.%20).

Build season for ATLaS started on Jan. 4, 2014, and lasted 6 weeks. ATLaS operated with an intake, drive train, and launcher.

Over the summer of 2018, students and mentors from the leadership team took the opportunity to rebuild and reprogram ATLaS with modern parts.
