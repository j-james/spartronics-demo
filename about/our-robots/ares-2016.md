## Meet ARES
_Advanced Robot Engineered for Siege_

Our 2016 robot, **ARES**, is appropriately named after the Greek god of war. Our robot is built for a game based on breaching defenses, catapuling “boulders”, and capturing opponent towers.

#### Chassis
- Dimensions: 14 inches tall; 35in x 37.5in (with bumpers)
- Custom u-shaped chassis

#### Motor Controllers
- 8 Talon SRX
- 1 Talon SR for scaling

#### Flywheel
- 6,000 - 7,000 RPM

#### Wheels
- Gear ratio: 8.67:1
- 14-inch wooden and omni wheels (all student hand-made, team design - held back)

#### Scaling System
- Gear radio: 70:1 (held back)

#### Laucher
- Launching mechanism has high-powered flywheels that feed a ball, enabling us to launch it by reversing the wheels
- Flywheel system intake and launch balls; pivots using motor system / potentiometer

#### Innovative Intake
- ARES has two flywheels that can take in balls and launch them

#### Autonomous
- Autonomous chooser allows us to choose different options for each match
- Can choose between 5 field positions, 5 obstacles that we can breach and 4 strategies
- Strategies are do nothing, breach, breach and shoot, or breach and shoot while using vision processing (auto targeting: flashlight for manual targeting)

#### Programming
- Written in Java
- Command-based system
- Programmed 3 susbsystem & vision processing on an NVIDIA Jetson

#### Game Play
- Go under low bar
- Can pass the rock wall, moat, rough terrains, and ramparts, also can open the sally port from the back
