#### How did THEMIS get its name?
Since our first robot - ATLaS - Spartronics (a derivative of Spartans or Sparta, from ancient Greece) decided to relate our robot to Greek Mythology and name our robots after a Greek deity.

Themis was the Greek God of Divine Order, Fairness, and Law. These aspects of the goddess align very well with FIRST’s own values of cooperation and gracious professionalism. The Scales of Justice, Themis' symbol, also relate to the year’s game and its scale game element.

Each robot name is also an acronym, based on the robot's unique capabilities or features:
