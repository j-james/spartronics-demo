#### Launcher
- Has two axes of freedom, one that adjusts the rails that the ball rides on, and one that adjusts the angle of the flywheel
- Has an 85% accuracy in autonomous and with a full load of balls 70% in teleop
- Primary structral components made out of Baltic Birch
- Cut using a CNC
- Uses a CIM without a gearbox to get the necessary torque without RPM reduction
- Uses a Banesbots T81 wheel for the flywheel

#### Intake
- 10:1 gear ratio on a BAG motor
- 1" Urethane belts (6)
- West Coast Products roller system
- 1.25" drum
- 19" wide- room for ~4 balls at once
- Yoga mat as padding for the back wall

#### Agitator
- 14 inch diameter baseplate wood ~6" tall aluminum sides
- Snowblower motor
- 6" x 2" paddles (4)
- 17.5" shaft up middle
- Roller to reduce jams

#### Climber and Rope
- CIM Motor
- 35:1 gear ratio
- 1" drum diameter
- Brake incorporated for safer lowering
- Ratchet incorporated to allow motor to be stopped at the top of the climb
- Approach for climber to catch rope: Hook side of Velcro on climber drum + polypropylene segment of rope at the bottom that acts as the loop side of Velcro

### FAQs about Helios

#### What can your robot HELIOS do?
- Shoot (about 70%-80% accuracy, with storage capacity of about 35 balls)
- Intake from the ground _and_ from the hoppers
- Place gears (passive holder allows us to retrieve gears from human players, but not the ground)
- Climb (can easily complete in under 10 seconds once rope is acquired)

#### What part of the field do you prefer to play?
Shooting right up against the boiler (in the key). We can also retrieve and place gears.

#### What do you do during autonomous?
We have 3 options.
- Shoot 10 balls into the boiler (~80% accurate) and cross the auto line
- Place center gear (less reliable, but doable if aligned correctly)
- Just drive straight across the line

#### What's your drivetrain?
Six-wheel drop-center, belt-driver, 4 CIMs. Nothing fancy, but it gives us plenty of speed and maneuverability on the field. Gear ratio of ~8:1.

#### Have you had any problems with HELIOS?
It took us a while to tune our launcher, and have had to deal with wear and tear on the launcher flywheel and intake belts.

#### What's the coolest part of your robot?
We've got a pretty sweet climber.

#### What programming language do you use?
Java.

#### Why is your robot called HELIOS?
Since our first robot - ATLaS - Spartronics (a derivative of Spartans or Sparta, from ancient Greece) decided to relate our robot to Greek Mythology and name our robots after a Greek deity.

Each robot name is also an acronym, based on the robot's unique capabiliities or features:
- [ATLaS]({% link about/our-robots/atlas-2014.md %}) - Advanced Tele-operated Launching System (2014)
- [GAEA]({% link about/our-robots/gaea-2015.md %}) - Grabbing Actuated Elevator Automation (2015)
- [ARES]({% link about/our-robots/ares-2016.md %}) - Advanced Robot Engineered for Siege (2016)
- [HELIOS]({% link about/our-robots/helios-2017.md %}) - Highly Efficient Launcher and Intake Oriented System (2017)
